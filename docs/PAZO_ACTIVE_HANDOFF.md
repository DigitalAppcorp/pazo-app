# PAZO — ACTIVE HANDOFF

**Project Brain OS:** v1.3.0  
**Canonical OS:** `DigitalAppcorp/project-brain-os`  
**Product Owner:** Brandon  
**Current state:** Fase 12 COMPLETADA  
**Active product module:** Production Hardening — infraestructura obligatoria  
**Gate:** Production Hardening Gate 8 EN CURSO  
**Decision:** MVP REDUCIDO  
**Supabase production mutation authorization:** Fase 12 aplicada y verificada

## Startup protocol

Before acting:
1. activate/read Project Brain OS v1.3.0 from `DigitalAppcorp/project-brain-os`;
2. read `AGENTS.md`;
3. read this file;
4. read `docs/PAZO_MASTER_ROADMAP.md`;
5. read `docs/PAZO_MODULE_LIFECYCLE.md`;
6. audit the real current `main` and open PRs before changing code.

Do not reconstruct project state from chat memory when repository evidence exists.

## Working model

- Brandon is Product Owner.
- ChatGPT owns product reasoning, architecture, implementation, backend, security, tests, Git/PR and durable docs.
- Antigravity/local is execution + visual validation only.
- Never mutate Supabase without explicit Product Owner authorization.
- Preserve already-approved behavior and avoid silent regressions.

## Fase 8 — final closure

**Status:** COMPLETADA / Gate 9 measurement.

## Fase 12 — final closure

**Status:** COMPLETADA / Gate 9 measurement.

Product:
- Explore was redefined as PAZO Global Search;
- searchable identity = public pet profiles, never human accounts;
- MVP providers = Pets + Communities + Places;
- Search lives in Header;
- Communities is a primary bottom-nav module;
- Posts and Events are outside this MVP.

Delivery:
- federated Search with independent providers;
- deterministic per-domain ranking;
- minimal type filters;
- debounce + stale-response protection;
- partial-provider failure tolerance;
- Search → public pet profile: PASS;
- Search → Community: PASS;
- Search → Map Place: PASS;
- manual return/navigation does not reopen consumed targets: PASS;
- old Explore container removed;
- Communities core reused rather than rebuilt.

Build/runtime evidence:
- pre-telemetry local build: PASS;
- final post-telemetry local build: PASS;
- Product Owner runtime/visual QA: PASS;
- Pet search: PASS;
- Community search: PASS;
- Place search: PASS;
- empty state/filter behavior: PASS;
- Feed / Communities / Map / My Pet smoke test: PASS;
- F5 persistence/stability smoke test: PASS.

Supabase:
- `20261007102632 phase_12_search_telemetry`;
- `20261007102748 index_search_usage_events_user`;
- RLS/grants/constraints: PASS;
- anon telemetry access: blocked;
- authenticated client: approved INSERT columns only;
- no client SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE;
- no raw query, entity id, owner id or GPS stored;
- live runtime telemetry observed: 33 events / 1 session during Product Owner QA;
- runtime telemetry included search opens, searches with/without results, all four filter states used, and result opens for pet/community/place;
- Security Advisor: no new Fase 12 security findings;
- FK index performance finding corrected forward.

Git final:
- PR #28 merged;
- merge commit `6ebc2e5d70b2cee37e7444916a03479b9b9d1d90`;
- `main` verified after merge;
- Global Search code present on `main`;
- both Phase 12 migration files present on `main`;
- canonical Phase 12 docs on `main` show Gate 8 CLOSED / Phase 12 COMPLETE;
- Vercel failures were quota/rate-limit only and were not used as build evidence.

**Scope Closure Reconciliation: PASS.**

Next:
- Production Hardening ocupa temporalmente el Carril de Implementación;
- Fase 12 permanece COMPLETADA / Gate 9 medición;
- no iniciar Fase 13 hasta cerrar el tranche crítico de hardening.

## Active infrastructure — Production Hardening

Canonical:
- `docs/PAZO_PRODUCTION_HARDENING_MASTER.md`

Branch:
- `infra/production-hardening-1`

Current scope:
- PayPal webhook security;
- supporter pitch safety;
- React crash containment;
- CI baseline;
- observability/auth/key/cost hardening next.

Monetization intent remains valid, but supporter membership is temporarily hidden until secure backend confirmation plus product eligibility/price/benefits are defined.


### Production Hardening checkpoint
- PR #30: Draft;
- CI production build: PASS;
- legacy lint debt: 114 problems discovered; currently informational/non-blocking;
- supporter pitch removed from active frontend;
- browser-side Founder activation removed;
- Supabase browser key migrated to modern publishable key;
- PayPal webhook v3 deployed to production with fail-closed + PayPal signature verification logic;
- PayPal private secrets/runtime verified delivery: PENDING;
- Error Boundary global: implemented;
- Security Advisor: baseline only; Leaked Password Protection still pending.


### Production Hardening checkpoint — expanded
- PO runtime: PASS for removal of premature PayPal pitch/reload behavior.
- Social write anti-abuse migration: `20261007123638`, deployed + transactional PASS.
- Document finalize noise migration: `20261007124041`, deployed + transactional PASS.
- Error Boundary + privacy-minimal observability: implemented.
- PostHog env contract: implemented; external project ingestion verification PENDING.
- PostHog ChatGPT app: installed, actions not exposed in this session.
- Vercel ChatGPT app: installed, actions not exposed in this session.
- Auth UX/local baseline: 8+ chars, upper/lower/digit; fake Google/Apple bypass removed.
- Supabase hosted plan: Free; leaked-password protection therefore remains pending without forcing an upgrade.
- Inactive PayPal frontend SDK: removed.
- Expected 400/409 operational noise fixes: implemented.
- CI hardening regression test: implemented.
- Do NOT reactivate supporter membership until PayPal secrets + genuine webhook verification + product pricing/benefit/eligibility decisions are closed.


### Rescue/security checkpoint
- Migration `20261007124633_move_rescue_security_definers_private`: deployed.
- Public Rescue/Founder RPCs are now SECURITY INVOKER wrappers; privileged logic lives in non-exposed `rescue_private`.
- Anonymous wrapper test: PASS.
- Authenticated wrapper test: PASS.
- Security Advisor: 0 exposed SECURITY DEFINER warnings; only Leaked Password Protection remains.
- Supabase plan is Free, so do not upgrade solely for that warning without explicit PO approval.
- Cost rules canonical: `docs/PAZO_COST_GUARDRAILS.md`.
- PostHog exception protocol verified against current docs; structured redacted stack frames implemented.
